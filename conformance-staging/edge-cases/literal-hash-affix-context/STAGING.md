# Staged conformance case: literal hash boundary in affix rewrite contexts

## Why this fixture exists

This reproduces the context authored in Motif's `PrefixRootRewriteTraceTests`: its left and right
contexts point to a user-created `PhBdryMarker` whose code is `#`. HermitCrab treats that object as
a literal boundary marker in the shape. It is distinct from a word-edge anchor (`#` authored as a
word-boundary condition). Since the affix/root shape contains `+?`, not a literal `#` segment, the
rewrite does not produce `ta` or `at`.

The fixture covers the one-segment prefix, a root-initial underlying `r`, a two-segment prefix, an
internal `r` control, and the suffix-final mirror. The expected unchanged forms and absent rewritten
forms are the C# oracle behavior for this authored grammar.

## Founding-oracle evidence

`words.yaml` signatures and rule traces were checked by the C# HermitCrab conformance harness built
from the pinned Machine commit `18cf242f4b114b0eb9bac304b4b171ca2f499a39` on 2026-10-09. The
targeted self-check passed: 1 fixture, 0 failed. The harness accepted `ra`, `raa`, `ara`, `ar`,
and `a`; it rejected `ta`, `taa`, `ata`, and `at`.

The Motif report's object inspection confirms the authored left context has kind `boundary` and a
marker GUID, rather than the word-boundary context kind. That matches this fixture. The earlier
word-edge-anchor fixture passed both engines, so no PanGloss parser divergence is demonstrated.
