# STAGING: segment-natural-class-table-binding

## Why this fixture exists

Closes a conformance-**suite-design** blind spot (not a code bug in this crate): every existing
multi-table fixture (`two-table-shared-representation-recall`,
`multi-table-metathesis-shared-representation`, `bistratal-overlapping-segment-representation`)
builds its rules' natural classes from **`FeatureNaturalClass`** only. `pg_rules::bridge::
PatternBridge`'s `nat_class_lanes` `NaturalClassKind::Feature` branch never reads `self.table` at
all -- a `SymbolicFeature`'s bit assignment is grammar-wide, not per-table, so feature-kind lanes are
table-agnostic by construction. That means **no fixture in the suite could ever detect a wrong-table
char-def resolution**: a rule wrongly compiled against table 0 instead of its own owning stratum's
table would still resolve every `FeatureNaturalClass` identically, and every existing multi-table
fixture would keep passing regardless. This is precisely how an eleven-`TableId(0)`-site defect in
the confirm engine (including the production entry points for every ordinary rewrite rule) survived
undetected by the whole conformance suite -- the only thing that ever caught it was a unit test
written specifically to exercise the table-**dependent** path
(`rust/crates/pg-rules/src/cache.rs`'s `owning_table_tests` module).

Only `NaturalClassKind::Segments` (`<SegmentNaturalClass>`) is genuinely table-**dependent**: its
members are raw per-table `CharDefId`s with no table of their own, resolved via
`self.table.get(cd)` -- a real, observable dependency on which table the caller passes in. This
fixture's own `grammar.xml` transplants `cache.rs`'s inline two-table/two-stratum probe grammar into
a real, lexicon-bearing conformance fixture (rather than a hand-built `Grammar` value only a unit
test can see), so the SAME table-dependent property becomes visible to **conformance**, closing the
gap `cache.rs`'s comment already named ("this module's fix for the 'implicit table-zero default'
antipattern class... the functions below are its confirm-side/oracle equivalent").

## Structural shape

- `Grammar::char_tables.len() == 2`: `t0` ("Inner", 1 segment "z", `f`=+), `t1` ("Outer", 2 segments:
  "k" `f`=-, "g" `f`=+).
- `Grammar::strata.len() == 2`: S0 (Inner, table t0, no rules) is FIRST; S1 (Outer, table t1, owning
  `prKtoG`) is SECOND (non-first) -- also the grammar's LAST stratum, so ROOT2 (entered directly on
  S1) is reachable at the surface (this codebase's own surface-tokenization convention segments the
  initial input only against the grammar's LAST stratum's table --
  `bistratal-overlapping-segment-representation`'s own STAGING.md documents this same architectural
  fact).
- `prKtoG` (obligatory, no environment: `SegmentNaturalClass` `ncK`={k} -> `ncG`={g}) is the ONE
  phonological rule, wired only into S1's own `phonologicalRules` cascade.
- `ncK`'s one member ("k") sits at table 1's raw index 0 -- the SAME raw index table 0's own sole
  segment ("z") sits at, but with the OPPOSITE feature value (`f`=- vs. `f`=+), deliberately, so a
  wrong-table (table-0) resolution of `ncK` can never accidentally still match a real table-1 "k".
  This mirrors every existing multi-table fixture's own "deliberately misaligned raw indices"
  convention, and `cache.rs`'s own probe grammar's identical choice, verbatim.
- ROOT1 (Inner stratum, table t0, spelled "z") is a same-table, rule-untouched decoy proving the
  "more than one table, one per stratum" construct has genuine substance on BOTH tables, not merely
  the rule-bearing one.

## What it pins

- `g`: ROOT2 (Outer stratum, table t1), correctly voiced ("k" -> "g") by the obligatory rule whose
  own `SegmentNaturalClass`es are resolved against t1. **Positive** -- this is the word that is
  UNREACHABLE under a wrong-table resolution (see "Discriminating power" below).
- `k`: ROOT2's own raw (unvoiced) spelling -- `expect_fail: true` (the rule is obligatory, no
  optionality).
- `z`: ROOT1 (Inner stratum, first/non-final table) -- `expect_skip: true` per the surface-
  tokenization convention above (a bare Inner-stratum root is never a complete, tokenizable surface
  word in this architecture -- the same fact `bistratal-overlapping-segment-representation`'s own
  STAGING.md documents, not a finding specific to this fixture).
- `gk`: a well-formed string over t1's own alphabet ("g"/"k" both legitimate t1 segments) that is not
  any real lexical entry's own shape -- `expect_fail: true`, a plain negative control.

## Discriminating power (proof, not assertion)

A fixture that would ALSO pass under a wrong-table resolution has exactly the blind-spot problem
this fixture exists to close -- so its discriminating power must be demonstrated, not merely
claimed. `rust/crates/pg-foma/tests/segment_natural_class_table_binding_discriminates.rs` does this
directly, via `pg_rules::bridge::PatternBridge`'s own PUBLIC API (`with_table`/`compile_pattern`) --
the exact seam `nat_class_lanes`'s `Segments` branch lives behind -- rather than by editing any
crate's `src/` (this task does not own `pg-rules/src`, and the real per-word cached call path,
`RuleCache`/`synthesize_with_mpr_cached`, is `pub(crate)`-only inside `pg-rules`, unreachable from a
`pg-foma` test without such an edit). `PatternBridge::new` itself defaults to `TableId(0)` (its own
doc: "resolving against table `TableId(0)`") -- literally the antipattern default this whole bug
class is about -- so `PatternBridge::new(&g)` with no `.with_table(..)` call IS the bug's own
resolution, reused directly as the "wrong" comparison arm; `.with_table(TableId(1))` is the rule's
real owning table (S1, the same table `RuleCache::build`'s `owning_table_for_prule` resolves this
rule to in the real, already-fixed production path).

Compiling `prKtoG`'s LHS (`ncK`) both ways and comparing against a REAL table-1 "k" segment's own
feature lanes, both outputs observed (`cargo test -p pg-foma --test
segment_natural_class_table_binding_discriminates -- --nocapture`):

```
OUTPUT 1 (correct table, TableId(1)): ncK lanes = [2, 1], real "k" lanes = [2, 1], flat_unifiable = true
OUTPUT 2 (wrong table, TableId(0), PatternBridge::new's own default): ncK lanes = [1, 1], real "k" lanes = [2, 1], flat_unifiable = false
```

Resolved against its own table (1), `ncK`'s compiled constraint equals table 1's own "k" lanes
exactly and matches a real "k" segment -- reachable, matching `words.yaml`'s `g` -> `"ROOT2|g"`.
Resolved against table 0 instead (the bug), `ncK`'s compiled constraint becomes table 0's own "z"
lanes -- a different, non-unifiable value -- and a real table-1 "k" segment no longer matches it at
all. `pg_fst::CompileNode::Constraint`'s own doc states its match rule is exactly
`pg_featstruct::flat_unifiable` -- this is not a hand-rolled stand-in predicate, it is the literal
per-arc match rule every FST this bridge compiles uses. Concretely: had the eleven-site
`TableId(0)`-default defect existed in `SegmentNaturalClass` resolution, `prKtoG` could never fire on
a real "k", ROOT2 could never surface as "g", and this fixture's own `g` -> `"ROOT2|g"` ground truth
would be unreachable -- exactly the failure class this fixture exists to catch, demonstrated over
the real production compile seam, not a hand-rolled simulation of it.

## `NaturalClass: Segments vs FeatureNaturalClass/SegmentNaturalClass precision` (constructs.txt row
## 34) as its own coverage tag

Tagged (alongside row 36, the multi-table construct) on `g`/`k`, the two words whose ground truth
actually depends on `SegmentNaturalClass`'s table-bound resolution. `z`/`gk` tag only row 36 (they
exercise the multi-table structural shape but not the table-dependent natural-class resolution
itself -- `z` never reaches `prKtoG` at all, and `gk`'s negative-control status doesn't depend on
which table `ncK`/`ncG` resolved against).

## Oracle discipline

**Oracle: `pangloss` (this repo's own Rust engine), NOT the C# founding oracle.** Authored fresh for
this task; `words.yaml` signatures captured via a throwaway test
(`rust/crates/pg-parse/tests/zz_throwaway_sig_dump.rs`, deleted after transcription) driving
`pg_parse::Morpher::parse_word` directly over every word.

## Verification

Cross-checked in-repo by `rust/crates/pg-parse/tests/conformance_fixtures_gate.rs`'s
`all_discovered_fixtures_match_oracle` test (dual-root discovery, default `cargo test --workspace`
suite) -- that test is what actually gates CI, and runs against the REAL, already-fixed production
path (`pg_parse::Morpher`, which threads `RuleCache::build`'s `owning_table_for_prule` resolution).
The discriminating-power claim above is pinned directly by `rust/crates/pg-foma/tests/
segment_natural_class_table_binding_discriminates.rs`.

## `structural_witness_gate.rs`: considered, not extended

That gate's own job is narrower than it might look: its three registered witnesses each answer "does
some PASSING fixture's grammar structurally exhibit construct X, so its shared `constructs.txt` row
id isn't resting solely on a coarser sibling's evidence?" -- for row ids that are shared between TWO
different `CharacteristicKind`s (`pg_foma::conformance_coverage::construct_ids_for`'s "shared id" set:
`Stratum (Linear/Unordered rule order)`, the iterative-rewrite-rule row, and
`AffixProcessRule: prefix/suffix/circumfix/infix`). Row 34 (`NaturalClass: Segments vs
FeatureNaturalClass/SegmentNaturalClass precision`) and row 36 (`CharacterDefinitionTable: more than
one table, one per stratum`) are each mapped from exactly ONE `CharacteristicKind` apiece in
`construct_ids_for` -- neither is a shared id at risk of the specific silent-inheritance failure mode
that gate exists to close (one `CharacteristicKind`'s `Covered` status resting on a DIFFERENT
`CharacteristicKind`'s fixture). Extending that gate's own registry to a fourth, unshared-id entry
would not be wrong, but it would not be answering the question that gate was built to ask either --
it already effectively "just works" (`conformance_coverage_gate.rs`'s own coverage report) since a
single characteristic's `Covered` verdict already requires a real passing fixture tagging its own
row id, no sibling-inheritance possible when there is no sibling. This fixture's own real
discriminating-power risk (a fixture that would ALSO pass under a wrong-table resolution) is a
DIFFERENT question from what `structural_witness_gate.rs` checks, and is instead answered directly by
`segment_natural_class_table_binding_discriminates.rs` above -- the right tool for this specific
claim, not a forced fit into the witness-gate's own narrower contract.
