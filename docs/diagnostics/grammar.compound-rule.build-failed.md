## Background

# How the parser uses a FieldWorks project

The importer reads FieldWorks project data and builds a grammar the parser can run. A diagnostic identifies a source condition or a construction the parser could not represent. Read its description for the named object, field, and observed cause.

Some findings describe source data that is missing or inconsistent. Others describe a valid construction that the current parser skips, approximates, or handles with a reduced set of constraints. The next step depends on the outcome: repair a demonstrated source defect, and preserve valid linguistic data when the finding describes a parser limitation.

A FieldWorks destination is included only when the relevant tool path is known. A missing destination means the finding is grammar-wide, its source owner varies, or no verified editable field is established. Use the diagnostic description to locate the source data, then report a valid case the parser cannot preserve.
