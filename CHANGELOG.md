file has no section for.

## 0.2.0

The release theme is honesty made mechanical: the capability envelope, the C# founding oracle, and
the measurement gates that keep both from drifting.

### Backends and capability

- **The capability envelope is authoritative before any compile.** Every backend consults
  `refuse_unless_admitted` and refuses with typed `CapabilityDiagnostic`s naming the predicate,
  construct, and witness — never a free-text failure after the fact.
- **All five reference grammars now have an accepted backend** (previously Aweti and Mbugwe had
  none, and Sena's PlanComposed was refused). The unlocking fixes:
  - `REP_VARIANT_CAP` (a count cap that silently discarded root spellings) replaced by an advisory
    breadth threshold plus a byte budget, reported through `VariantLimit` — representability,
    readiness, and containment each answered separately. A complete enumeration is emitted in full
    however large; only an unbounded `*` shape or the byte budget can drop a spelling, and each is
    reported.
  - **Circumfix cross-product loading**: a FieldWorks circumfix entry (prefix-typed x suffix-typed
    halves) now builds one allomorph per pairing, with both halves' environments and positions
    unioned per C#'s own `HCLoader` behavior. Per-side conditioning works via per-run environment
    anchoring (W3.3). Open, documented: N-way cross-products sharing a literal half still
    over-generate versus C#'s disjunctive-allomorph re-check.
- Backend scoreboard (61+ fixtures x 3 backends) extracted from an example into
  `pg_foma::scoreboard` with typed per-cell outcomes, gated by a both-direction ratchet: a worsened
  count is a regression, an improved one fails until the constant is deliberately updated.
- Every capability predicate owes a negative witness (a fixture whose refusal cites it);
  the unwitnessed backlog is ratcheted and cannot grow.

### The C# founding oracle

- **The oracle hierarchy is now stated and enforced**: C# `hc.dll` is the founding oracle;
  HC-Rust (`pg_parse::Morpher`) is a port under test and never a source of truth. Every staged
  conformance fixture declares `# oracle-provenance:`; the rust-only backlog is ratcheted.
- `rust/tools/oracle-conformance.ps1` runs the C# self-check over both fixture roots with a
  commit-matched executable and a reasoned known-divergence baseline. Both this and the existing
  HC-Rust gate pinning the same committed `words.yaml` means HC-Rust and C# agree on the exact
  analysis set — over- and under-generation both caught.
- Found by that gate: six staged grammars the founding oracle rejects as schema-invalid (their
  correctness had never been knowable), and nine `filter-passes` fixtures the C# harness cannot
  discover — all named in the baseline rather than silently green.

### Conformance suite

- Submodule pin moved to `f42d9591` (`integrate-conformance-framework`), a squashed suite on
  mainline v3.9.3 — resolving the pin/tip schema incompatibility and the rebased-away pin.
- Conformance runs must claim their scope (`-Scope local|all`); fixture discovery panics on an
  unclaimed scope rather than guessing.

### Tooling

- `rust/tools/release.ps1`: gated release entry point (clean tree, zero hygiene violations,
  rustdoc, full suite, oracle differential) that stamps, tags, and builds — and never pushes.
- Comment-hygiene reaches zero violations and the release gate holds it there.
- `pg.ps1`: `-Mode check`/`quick`/`run`/`conformance-test`, memory-proportional spawn gates,
  kernel-enforced job objects, and the build-slot mutex fleet (see CLAUDE.md).

## 0.1.0

Initial tagged state: the `hc-*` to `pg-*` rename (`728ffd33`), the frozen HermitCrab model,
the foma-backed propose-and-confirm engine, and the four reference grammars.
